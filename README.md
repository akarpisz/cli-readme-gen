##Installation

Once you clone the repo to your local machine, navigate into the repo folder, and run the command "npm link". This will allow you to run the program in any directory, and generate the README file for the directory.

After installation, enter "gen" into the npm command line, and follow the prompts to create the README. It will write the file to the directory where you run the command. For the github picture, you must either upload a file to Github and enter the path, or use the URL of a photo hosted elsewhere.
